A word guy (MFA, creative non-fiction) dipping toes into the data stream. Interested in books, basketball -- fantasy and otherwise -- and biking Milwaukee County's Oak Leaf Trail.
Previously of Saint Mary's College of California (student), the University of California, Berkeley (staff), and editor-for-hire at Amazon Publishing (and other publishing houses of 
modest acclaim.) 

Presently, my days are spent editing fiction, taking Python courses online, and occasionally fantasy basket-blogging/podcasting at Razzball.com as Mr. Hooper. The eventual aim is 
to achieve Python proficiency to pair with my more analog storytelling tendencies. Cool and interesting divergences from this plan are welcome. My work (for now, at least) will
demonstrate my newness in this field and bend towards basketball and bikes.
